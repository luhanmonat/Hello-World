# Hello-World
My name is Luhan Monat.  I have spent most of my working carrier in electronics working with microprocessors and microcontrollers.

I've done a shitload of PIC programming.  I really like the total control of assembly language coding.

Then I discovered Arduino ...

Arduino uses a very good C compiler that does much more than Arduino lets on.  In addition to the C++ extensions, you get full (kinda) K&R C.  This includes: structures, unions, typedefs, enums, and multidimensional arrays.

A few of the fucntions like 'printf' are missing but you can simulate them using 'sprintf'.

When you select a 'board' - i.e. chip, you get full named access to every single one of it's registers.  This virtually eliminates the need to resort to inline assembler for tricky operations.
